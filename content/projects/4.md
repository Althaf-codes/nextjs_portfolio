During my time in college, I built a **Student Dental Management App** that streamlined how dental cases were recorded, tracked, and managed â€” designed specifically for dental students and doctors.  
This project was one of my most challenging yet rewarding experiences, as it required not only strong Flutter skills but also thoughtful problem-solving to meet real-world healthcare needs.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Modern Sleek UI** â€“ A clean and professional design to make data entry and navigation smooth for doctors.
- **Custom Dental Structure Widget** â€“ Built from scratch using `ShapeBorder` to represent teeth visually, with colors indicating problems.
- **Age-based Problem Filtering** â€“ Fetch patients or cases by their age, age-specific dental issues, or common problems for that age group.
- **Role-based Authorization** â€“ Doctors can only edit their own entries, while a **superAdmin** has full access.
- **Firebase Integration** â€“ Real-time queries for patient/student data, problems, and age-specific cases.
- **Provider State Management** â€“ Ensured smooth state updates and data flow across the app.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Flutter** (UI + State Management with Provider)
- **Firebase Firestore** (Real-time Database)
- **Firebase Auth** (Doctor & SuperAdmin access control)
- **ShapeBorder Custom Widgets** (for dental structures)

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

This project taught me:

- How to design and implement **custom widgets** for highly specialized use cases.
- The importance of **role-based permissions** in healthcare-related apps.
- Structuring Firebase queries for **fast and accurate data retrieval**.
- Creating **maintainable architecture** in Flutter using Provider.
