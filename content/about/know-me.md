# My Journey in Tech

## Who I Am

Hello! I'm a passionate software developer with a keen focus on **Flutter** and **Full-Stack Development**. Over the years, I've gained experience working on a variety of projects, both personal and professional, that helped me grow as an engineer. My journey began in a place far from the world of code and tech but led me to where I am today—a skilled and versatile developer with a love for creating dynamic, user-friendly applications.

## Where It All Started

### The Spark: **COVID-19 and the Shift to Tech**

Like many, I had no idea what my future would look like when **COVID-19** struck. As an **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** student, I was deep into my traditional engineering studies. However, the global pandemic made me rethink my future and passions.

I found myself at home with more time on my hands than ever before, and that’s when I discovered the world of **coding**. I dabbled in various languages, frameworks, and concepts, diving into the universe of technology with curiosity and excitement.

### Diving into Flutter

I remember discovering **Flutter** around this time, and it felt like the perfect fit. A framework that allows you to build **beautiful, cross-platform applications** with ease? I was hooked! I began working on small projects, experimenting with different UI designs, and exploring how Flutter could help me bring my ideas to life. It wasn’t long before I realized that this was my true calling—creating apps that can be used by real people.

## From Flutter to Full-Stack Development

### A Full-Stack Enthusiast

What started as a hobby quickly became more than just that. I wanted to go beyond the front-end and dive deeper into the entire development process. **Full-Stack Development** was the next logical step. I ventured into **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Firebase**, learning how to build powerful back-end services that could support the apps I was creating. 

Whether it was implementing **JWT-based authentication** for secure logins or building RESTful APIs, I was eager to master the full spectrum of development. The more I learned, the more I fell in love with the entire process—from concept to deployment.

### Building Real-World Projects

As my skills grew, I started applying what I learned to real-world projects. Here are some key projects I’ve worked on:

- **Netflix-style App**: A streaming service application with user authentication, dynamic content, and media playback.
- **Chat App**: A responsive, feature-rich chat app with real-time communication and media sharing.
- **Dental App**: A specialized app where doctors can manage patient data, access dental records, and offer consultations.

Each project has pushed my limits, helped me explore new frameworks and libraries, and taught me valuable lessons on scalability, performance, and user experience.

## How It's Going Now

### Building My Portfolio

I’m now focused on creating a **portfolio website** that showcases my skills in Flutter development, back-end systems, and web applications. This website serves as both a **portfolio** and a **blog**, where I share insights on coding, development, and the tech industry. It’s a space to demonstrate my projects, share knowledge, and connect with other developers.

### Constantly Improving

I’m always looking for opportunities to grow and refine my skills. From learning **new tools** and **tech stacks** to following industry trends, I strive to stay on top of the ever-evolving world of tech. My goal is to constantly improve and push my boundaries.

## Where I Am Today

Today, I’m not just a **Flutter developer**. I am a **full-stack engineer** with a deep understanding of mobile app development, back-end architecture, and UI/UX design. With a passion for building products that matter, I’m eager to continue exploring new technologies and creating impactful solutions.

I’m always excited about the future of **software development**, and I can't wait to see what new challenges and opportunities lie ahead!
