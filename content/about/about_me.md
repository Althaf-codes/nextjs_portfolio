# My Journey in Tech

## Who I Am

### From Uncertainty to Unstoppable

Hey there 👋, I’m a self-taught software developer who turned uncertainty into opportunity.  
Before I ever wrote a single line of code, I was on a very different path — an Electronics and Communication Engineering student, following the traditional academic route. Then, the pandemic hit.

Like many, COVID-19 left me questioning my future. Internships froze, job opportunities vanished, and I found myself with a lot of time… and even more questions. But in that stillness, I discovered something powerful — **code**.

### The Spark That Changed Everything

At first, it was just curiosity. I started exploring different programming languages and concepts, just trying to keep my mind active. But when I stumbled upon **Flutter**, something clicked.

It felt magical — the ability to create beautiful, functional apps that worked on multiple platforms from a single codebase. I started building small projects, experimenting with designs, and learning not just _how_ to code, but _how to think like a developer_.

The deeper I went, the more I wanted to understand the _entire_ picture. That’s when I stepped into **full-stack development** — mastering Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase, and more. I learned how to create secure backends, manage databases, and connect everything into smooth, end-to-end systems.

### Building, Failing, Growing

I didn’t have a tech job or formal training, but I had something more important — **persistence**.

I built:

- A **Netflix Clone** with adaptive HLS streaming, from backend encoding pipelines to a Netflix-style UI.
- A **real-time WhatsApp-like chat app** with private/group messaging, read receipts, and online/offline status.
- A **Dental App** for doctors to manage patients and records.
- A **Vehicle Monitoring App** with real-time tracking, alerts, and hardware integration.
- And my biggest yet — **100xDevs**, an all-in-one learning and developer community platform.

Each project wasn’t just code — it was a lesson in problem-solving, resilience, and finding creative ways to deliver results even with limited resources.

### The Hard Truth

I won’t sugarcoat it — my journey hasn’t been easy.  
Despite building complex, production-ready projects, I’m still searching for that first big break in the industry. There were times I felt overlooked, times I doubted myself. But each “no” only made me more determined to turn it into a “yes.”

The reality? You don’t need to know _everything_ to be valuable. You need the ability to **learn fast, adapt quickly, and deliver solutions**. And that’s exactly what I’ve trained myself to do.

### Why I Keep Going

Because every line of code I write is a step toward the life I’m building.  
Because I know there’s someone out there who needs the solution I can create.  
Because the gap between me and my dream job is just one opportunity away.

I’m not just looking for a job — I’m looking for a chance to **make an impact**, to work with people who value skill, passion, and grit over credentials alone.
